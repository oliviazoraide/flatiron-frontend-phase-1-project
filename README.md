# Reader's Block
Reader's Block is a SPA (single page application) that generates a random book for the user to read.

## Installation

Installation is not required for this project. Simply navigate to the [Reader's Block website](https://oliviazoraide.github.io/flatiron-frontend-phase-1-project/).

## Usage
Generate a random book by genre:
1. Genres will automatically populate in the "Genre:" dropdown menu based on the JSON server's data. It currently only has data for about 40 books, so genres are limited.
2. Click the genre that you would like to read from the dropdown menu and the book title and author will populate in the results area.

Generate a random book:
1. Click the "generate" button
2. A book title and author will populate in the results area.
